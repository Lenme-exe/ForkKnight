# ForkKnight

ForkKnight is a 2d platformer made for the 2023-2024 AP gamedev course.

## TODO

- Start screen with start button, level select and quit
- 1st level to be implemented
- Game over screen
- Movement
- Enemies
- Coins
- Powerups (brainstorm)

### Enemies

3 different types of enemies.

- Green slime
- Blue slime
- Purple slime

Green slime walks around like a koopa trooper does in mario. Just back and forth on its platform without falling off.  
Blue slime will be stationary but will shoot slime at/in the direction of the player.  
Purple slime will attempt to follow the player, cannot jump.

### Movement

Player character needs to move and jump, I want a little bouncyness when character goes full speed into a wall/floor to bounce off it.  
Also needs to speed up and keep its momentum when jumping etc.

### Coins

The goal is to collect coins, if all coins have been collected you can advance to the next level.

### Powerups

I got no idea what I can add as a powerup
