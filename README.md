### Enemies

3 different types of enemies.

- Green slime
- Purple slime
- Void

Green slime walks around like a koopa trooper does in mario. Just back and forth on its platform without falling off.  
purple slime will be stationary but will shoot slime at/in the direction of the player.  
Void is a trap, fall off the map is instantly dead

### Coins

The goal is to collect coins, if all coins have been collected you can advance to the next level.
